# RandomIPs

This will probably never find use with anyone other than myself and is here more to just *document* my first GitHub repo using [Go](https://go.dev), though I do hope to revisit this as much as I can to improve upon it.

At this point there is nothing really special about this application.  It simply generates a random IP address.  I have, from time to time, needed something like this in my GNS3 labs to break from the use of the _10.x.x.x_ and the_192.168.x.x_ networks.  And for no other reason that just to be different and make things a little more challenging.

If you feel like loosing a minute or two that you will never get back in your life, there are binaries for both Linux and Windows 64-bit in the `bin` folder.  Enjoy!
